Hi, I'm Connor Yates.

I'm a software engineer with interests in project management, graphics, artificial intelligence, and UI/UX.
Consistency and simplicity of solutions is solidly in my personal discipline and desire.
I primarily use Linux/Unix, particularly Debian and Debian-based systems, for development and as development targets, as well as daily, general usage.
